# Jakes Turn Based Battle System
A turn based battle system demo I made in GameMaker Studio, using Sara Spaulding's Turn Based Combat Tutorial as a base.

## Additions and Changes made to the base project:


## To Review the Code:

GameMaker handles the storage of files for its users, in a way that is (in my humble opinion), very hard to navigate.

So in the interest of saving you the hassle, I'll point you to all of the important code.
